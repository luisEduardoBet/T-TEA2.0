# DAO Implementation
class PlayerCsvDAO(DAO):
    """Data Access Object for managing Player data in CSV files.

    This class implements the DAO interface to handle CRUD operations
    for Player objects, storing data in CSV files. It maintains an
    in-memory cache of players and maps player IDs to filenames.

    Attributes
    ----------
    csv_handler : CSVHandler
        Utility for reading and writing CSV files.
    players : Dict[int, Player]
        In-memory cache of Player objects, keyed by player ID.
    file_map : Dict[int, str]
        Maps player IDs to their corresponding CSV file paths.

    Methods
    -------
    __init__()
        Initializes the PlayerCsvDAO with an empty cache and loads
        existing players from CSV files.
    sanitize_filename(name: str) -> str
        Sanitizes a player name for safe file naming.
    get_filename(player: Player) -> str
        Generates a filename for a player based on ID and name.
    load_all_players() -> None
        Loads all player data from CSV files into memory.
    insert(obj: Player) -> Optional[Union[int, str, bool]]
        Inserts a new player and creates a corresponding CSV file.
    update(obj: Player) -> Optional[Union[int, bool]]
        Updates player data and renames the file if the name changes.
    delete(obj_id: int) -> Optional[Union[int, bool]]
        Deletes a player from memory and removes their CSV file.
    select(obj_id: int) -> Optional[Player]
        Retrieves a player by their ID.
    list() -> List[Player]
        Returns a list of all players.
