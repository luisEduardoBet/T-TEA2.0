class WindowConfig:
    """Class for fixed window configurations of the exergame application.

    This class provides methods to configure and manage window properties,
    such as title, icon, size, and positioning, with options to adjust size
    based on percentage increments or decrements relative to a parent window
    or screen.

    Attributes
    ----------
    STAY_SIZE : int
        Constant indicating that the window size should remain unchanged
        (value: 0).
    INCREMENT_SIZE_PERCENT : int
        Constant indicating that the window size should be increased by a
        percentage (value: 1).
    DECREMENT_SIZE_PERCENT : int
        Constant indicating that the window size should be decreased by a
        percentage (value: 2).

    Methods
    -------
    setup_window(title, icon, status=STAY_SIZE, width=0, height=0, parent=None)
        Configures the window properties such as title, icon, size,
        and position.
    get_base_size(parent)
        Returns the base size based on the parent window or the screen.
    adjust_size(base, percent, status)
        Adjusts the base size according to the status and percentage provided.
    center_window(parent=None, width=None, height=None)
        Centers the window relative to the parent window or the screen.

        This method sets the window's title and icon, calculates the base size
        based on the parent or screen, adjusts the size according
        to the provided status and percentage, and centers the window.

        Parameters
        ----------
        title : str
            The title to be set for the window.
        icon : str
            The file path to the icon to be set for the window.
        status : int, optional
            The size adjustment status. Must be one of `STAY_SIZE`,
            `INCREMENT_SIZE_PERCENT`, or `DECREMENT_SIZE_PERCENT`.
            Default is `STAY_SIZE` (0).
        width : float, optional
            Percentage adjustment for the window width. Ignored if `status` is
            `STAY_SIZE`. Default is 0.
        height : float, optional
            Percentage adjustment for the window height. Ignored if `status` is
            `STAY_SIZE`. Default is 0.
        parent : QWidget, optional
            The parent window used for size and centering reference.
            If None, the screen geometry is used. Default is None.

        Returns
        -------
        None

        Notes
        -----
        - The window is set to a fixed size after configuration to prevent
        resizing.
        - The `width` and `height` parameters represent percentage adjustments
          (e.g., 10 means 10%) and are applied only if `status` is
          `INCREMENT_SIZE_PERCENT` or `DECREMENT_SIZE_PERCENT`.
